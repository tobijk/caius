description: "Caius is a functional testing framework for the 21st century. It was born out of the need for a contemporary replacement for DejaGnu. Caius is written in object-oriented Tcl and provides easy-to-use programming interfaces to Selenium WebDriver and Expect. Through its extensible reporting system, Caius integrates well with modern CI systems and test management tools."
